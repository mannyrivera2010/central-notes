Problem:  
You have a piece of text, find the number of occurrences per character.
The output should be ordered ascending by the character.
Code should be written so that it is easy to run over multiple inputs.

```
string_1 = '1258641a28755549631bkmmmikdika'
```
Console output should be
```
The value 1 has 3 occurrences
The value 2 has 2 occurrences
The value 3 has 1 occurrences
The value 4 has 2 occurrences
The value 5 has 4 occurrences
The value 6 has 2 occurrences
The value 7 has 1 occurrences
The value 8 has 2 occurrences
The value 9 has 1 occurrences
The value a has 2 occurrences
The value b has 1 occurrences
The value d has 1 occurrences
The value i has 2 occurrences
The value k has 3 occurrences
The value m has 3 occurrences
```
